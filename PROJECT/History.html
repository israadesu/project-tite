<h1>History<h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">Skechers was founded in 1992 by Robert Greenberg, who had previously founded LA Gear in 1983 (he stepped down as CEO of that company the same year he founded Skechers). 
Greenberg sought to focus on men's street shoes; Skechers' early products were utility-style boots popular in grunge fashion. 
The company quickly expanded to include women and children, with casual and athletic styles, and went public in 1999.
In 2011, Skechers launched its performance line for athletes and signed Meb Keflezighi as a spokesman.</p>
